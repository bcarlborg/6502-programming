# 6502-programming

Programs written for the 6502 8 bit CPU running on a home built breadboard system.

These programs are specifically designed to run on system similar to the one designed and implemented in Ben Eaters Design a 6502 from scratch [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH). The system used for teh code in this repository is specific implementation of Ben Eaters. Differences between the two systems are described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).


## Additional Info
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): Describes design of the system hardware, semi-acurrate schematics, and annotated images of the system on breadboards.
- [PROGRAMMERS_GUIDE.MD](PROGRAMMERS_GUIDE.md): Provides an overview of the system from a programmers perspective.
  - Describes the toolchain used to assemble and link binaries along with where those tools can be found and built.
  - Provides an overview of some in code constructs that are used frequently throughout the project.
  - Describes basic style and conventions used in the programs.
- [DEMOS.md](DEMOS.md) Demos of the various projects contained in this repository
