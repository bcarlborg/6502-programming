PROJECT TODOS:
- code quality
  - find a style guide + general tips for assembly programming (maybe a linter?)
    - comment style
    - naming convention
  - decide on a calling convention (registers etc)

- Code structure
  - make a macro for loading and storing adrresses

notes for the harness
- loop and reset in the harness can be their own symbols loop_harness reset_harness,
  - they can be registered by the vectors array, then other modules that want to use
  - them can just write their own loop and reset functions that are called by the harness
    - I'll have to figure out a way to only call those functions if a symbols is defined
      for them, but that can be later... For now, some functions can just be required
      like onButtonPress, reset, and loop

Immediate todos
- create a more modular way to register interrupt handlers, that way
  I can move the timing logic out of main
